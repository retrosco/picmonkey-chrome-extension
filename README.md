The PicMonkey Chrome Extension lets you instantly grab images from any Web page ~and open them up in PicMonkey for editing~. Here’s how it works: click the PicMonkey icon when you’re viewing a web page. In one kajillionth of a second, every image on that page and a screenshot of the entire page appears as a tiny thumbnail in a sidebar. ~Select one to edit, and wah-la! PicMonkey shows up to do your bidding. PicMonkey is a free online photo editor that says Booyah! to whatever your creative heart desires. Its lean and fast engine lets you perform basic edits, like crop and rotate, and enhance your images with luscious effects, overlays, fonts, textures, frames and touch up tools. Ridiculously easy, staggeringly gorgeous. Check out the PicMonkey Chrome App too! www.picmonkey.com~
